        <h2 class="service-section-title">Context</h2>
        <p>
          Ellora Natural Seeds operates across multiple states, crops and channels.
          Ground teams, distributors and internal teams were already sharing data,
          but it lived in different Excel files and formats.
        </p>
        <p>
          Management wanted a <strong>single, reliable dashboard</strong> to see
          sales, schemes and performance by region, crop and variety – without
          waiting days for manual consolidation.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3 class="service-section-subtitle">Key Challenges</h3>
        <ul class="service-list">
          <li>Data coming from different teams in different templates.</li>
          <li>Heavy manual effort to clean and merge sheets every month.</li>
          <li>No easy way to compare states, zones and crops in one place.</li>
          <li>Leaders had to ask for custom cuts each time they needed an answer.</li>
        </ul>

    <article class="feature-card">
        <h3>Standardized Order Data Flow</h3>
        <p class="feature-tagline">Pending vs received in one place.</p>
        <p>
        We structured incoming data so <strong>received orders, pending orders</strong> and
        <strong>partial pending orders</strong> were consistently captured and easy to track
        for every zone, crop and party.
        </p>
    </article>

    <article class="feature-card">
        <h3>Order & Dispatch Control View</h3>
        <p class="feature-tagline">From “Did this go?” to clear dispatch efficiency.</p>
        <p>
          We built a Power BI “control tower” style view that showed <strong>dispatch efficiency</strong>,
          ageing of pending orders and where bottlenecks were building up in real time.
        </p>
    </article>

    <article class="feature-card">
        <h3>Top Parties & Focus Accounts</h3>
        <p class="feature-tagline">Know who to call first.</p>
        <p>
        Leadership could instantly see <strong>Top 5 parties</strong> by volume, value and
        pending position, helping teams prioritize follow-ups and align schemes and support.
